/// ## Note
/// This generic function is designed for parsing proto buffer files,
/// using bytes parsing, which is very high performance.
///
/// We may never not support proto buffer text files.
/// For comparison:
/// - `30-line` [`pbtxt`] file (using [`protobuf`]) takes `1.4ms`,
/// - `1800-line` [`pb`] file (using [`prost`]) takes `480Î¼s`.
///
/// Instead, we recommend using the provided [`python`] script or writing one yourself,
/// which only takes several lines to convert the pbtxt format to pb format
///
/// ```py
/// message = ModelDef()
/// with open(pbtxt_file_path, 'r') as f:
///     text_format.Merge(f.read(), message)
/// with open(binary_file_path, 'wb') as f:
///     f.write(message.SerializeToString())
/// ```
///
/// ## Performance Improvement
/// If you parse binary directly without using prost,
/// which can reduce memory allocation and loop process

/// ## Explanation
/// `Tensor` usually has two attributes: [`dtype`] and [`dims`],
/// and sometimes also has attributes such as [`device`] and [`layout`].
/// If this structure is sent directly to the front-end for processing,
/// most of the time, the front-end only do a string concatenation,
/// which brings the following disadvantages:
/// - Increased communication data volume
/// - Deeper object hierarchy (which may cause a sharp increase in JS GC time)
/// - Slower string concatenation that must be run [`every-time`] rendering
///
/// ## Note
/// However, it cannot be ignored that if the edge width needs to be adjusted
/// according to the data dimension, the design needs to be reconsidered.
